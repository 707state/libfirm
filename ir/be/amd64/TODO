amd64 backend TODO:
Correctness:
- Implement 32/64bit floatingpoint with SSE instructions
- Transform to Neg-Add in finish phase if should_be_same is not fulfilled.
- Implement more builtins (libgcc lacks several of them that gcc provides
  natively on amd64 so cparser/libfirm when linking to the compilerlib fallback)
- (Support 80bit long double with x87 instructions)
- Support ASM node
- Imm32 are sign extended in 64bit ops, we incorrectly match them as 32bit
  unsigned.

Improve Quality:
- Immediate32 matching could be better and match SymConst, Add(SymConst, Const)
  combinations where possible. Be carefull with PIC code this may usually not
  be legal!
- Match Immediate + Address mode for Cmp
- Support swapping of cmp arguments (see ins_permuted in ia32 backend)
- Support Read-Modify-Store operations (aka destination address mode)
- Leave out labels that are not jumped at (improves assembly readability, see
  ia32 backend output)
- Align certain labels if beneficial (see ia32 backend, compare with clang/gcc)
- Implement CMov/Set and announce this in mux_allowed callback
- We always Spill/Reload 64bit, we should improve the spiller to allow smaller
  spills where possible.
- Perform some benchmark comparison with clang/gcc and distill more issues to
  put on this list.
